# cljs-tutorial

A port for [nrepl][5] compliant editor/IDE of
[LightTable ClojureScript Tutorial][1] by [David Nolen][2] based on
[cljs-start][3] lein-template.

## Prerequisites

The same as [cljs-start][3] + Emacs:

* JDK >= 6.0 (7.0 it's better)
* Leiningen >= 2.3.4
* PhantomJS >= 1.9.1
* Emacs >= 24.x with [cider][4] package installed or Eclipse/CCW >= 0.22.0

Sublime Users:

* Sublime Text 3 (tested on build 3083)
* [SublimeREPL][7]
* Chrome/Firefox/Safari (not tested in other browsers)

<!-- prevent list breaking apart-->

  > NOTE: I did not test `cljs-tutorial` with others editors/IDE but
  > you should be able to replicate the same interactive experience
  > with any editor/IDE able to talk with nREPL.

## Eclipse/IDE Quickstart

Clone the `modern-cljs` repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
```

* Create a new project via `File > New > General > Project`. After
  entering `cljs-tutorial` as the name of the project, uncheck the
  `Use default location` checkbox, and check `Browse` to find the
  `cljs-tutorial` project folder inside the `modern-cljs`
  project. Once referenced as an Eclipse project, you should see it in
  the Package Explorer View;
* From the contextual menu of the project select `Configure > Convert
  to Leiningen Project`;
* From the contextual menu of the project select `Leiningen > Launch
  Headeless REPL for the Project` and wait for the REPL tab to be
  open;
* Evaluate `(run)` form in the REPL Tab
* Evaluate `(browser-repl)`
* Visit the [localhost:3000][6] URL to activate the Browser Connected
  REPL;
* Open the `core.cljs` file in the editor pane and start evaluating
  its content form by form by positioning the cursor after a form and
  typing `Cmd/Ctr Enter`.

## Emacs Quickstart

Clone the `modern-cljs` repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
```

Open the `core.cljs` file from the
`cljs-tutorial/src/cljs/cljs_tutorial` directory in your Emacs and
then issue the `C-c M-j` shortcut which corresponds to the `M-x
cider-jack-in` command.

Be patient because the command needs to download all the libs included
in the project, to compile the ClojureScript code and finally to
launch both the nREPL server and client components.

When the command completes, it shows you the Clojure nREPL prompt in a
new Emacs Buffer:

```clj
; CIDER 0.5.0alpha (package: 20131210.726) (Clojure 1.5.1, nREPL 0.2.3)
user>
```

Run the ClojureScript nREPL against the phantomjs JavaScript runtime
(PhantomJS Connected REPL) . If you receive more WARNINGs about Symbol
ISomething not being a protocol, don't care about them because they do
not compromise the running of the tutorial.

```clj
user> (cemerick.austin.repls/exec) ; to run the PhantomJS Connected REPL
Browser-REPL ready @ http://localhost:51631/1017/repl/start
WARNING: Symbol ILookup is not a protocol at line 940 /Users/mimmo/Developer/modern-cljs/cljs-tutorial/src/cljs/cljs_tutorial/core.cljs
...
WARNING: Symbol IMap is not a protocol at line 1108 /Users/mimmo/Developer/modern-cljs/cljs-tutorial/src/cljs/cljs_tutorial/core.cljs
Type `:cljs/quit` to stop the ClojureScript REPL
nil
cljs.user>
```

Now all you have to do is to evaluate form by form the `core.cljs`
file by positioning the cursor after the form and typing the usual
`C-c C-e` shortcut.

# EMACS ATTENTION NOTE

The tutorial source code contains references to JS entities not
available in the phantomjs JavaScript runtime. In such a case if you
evaluate any form including them you'll get an error.

If it disturbs you, just use the Browser Connected REPL instead of the
PhantomJS Connected REPL as follows:

```clj
user> (run) ; to run a local web-server based on ring/compojure/enlive libs
#<Server org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server@76e788e1>
user> (browser-repl) ; to run the Browser Connected REPL
Browser-REPL ready @ http://localhost:51665/4760/repl/start
WARNING: Symbol ILookup is not a protocol at line 940 /Users/mimmo/Developer/modern-cljs/cljs-tutorial/src/cljs/cljs_tutorial/core.cljs
...
WARNING: Symbol IMap is not a protocol at line 1108 /Users/mimmo/Developer/modern-cljs/cljs-tutorial/src/cljs/cljs_tutorial/core.cljs
Type `:cljs/quit` to stop the ClojureScript REPL
nil
cljs.user>
```

Now visit the `http://localhost:3000` to activate the Browser
Connected REPL and evaluate form by form the tutorial code from the
`core.cljs` source file by typing `C-c C-e` shortcut after the closing
parens of each form.

Enjoy.

## Sublime Quickstart

Clone the `modern-cljs` repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
```

Open the `project.clj` file from the
`cljs-tutorial` directory in Sublime and
run `SublimeREPL: ClojureScript Browser REPL` via the Command Palette.

Wait for the REPL window in Sublime to show a prompt `ClojureScript:cljs.user>`,
then visit `http://localhost:9000/repl`. An alert will appear, saying
`No 'xpc' param provided to child iframe.` To make the Browser REPL functional,
open the browser console, and enter the following lines:

```js
clojure.browser.repl.connect.call(null,"http://localhost:9000/repl");
clojure.browser.repl.client.start("http://localhost:9000");
```

Open `core.cljs` from the `cljs-tutorial/src/cljs/cljs_tutorial` directory,
set syntax to ClojureScript via the Command Palette (Clojure syntax 
will attempt to use a Clojure REPL), and use the following shortcuts
to evaluate directly in the REPL:

* `ctrl + ,` `b` Evaluate selected block
* `ctrl + ,` `l` Evaluate selected line -- useful for non-block code, i.e. without `()`
